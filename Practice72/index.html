    <p>So now I think I am quite conversant with my typing confidence. <br>
        Now I'm gonna be going beast mode on real coding.
    </p>
    
    <p>I can now see that typing is much more smoother and much 
        accurate than before. This is also by the help of my new keyboard alteration. Innit.
        So, lets close this website and now focus on Mabdev Website.
