We have all been brought to this earth to take up this challenge to overcome it. It is the game we are all playing. God programmes the game and decides which best opportunities you need to do what you need to do, utilise the chances to make it great Barasu Mark Eugene Korku, don't worry about unecessary things just focus on your dreams and make it bigger than what was created break the code and outstand everyone who will ever exit or existed</p>

                <p id="longerText" >I think this is just the start of things. I am just practicing how to design and develop a web page as a professional and I strongly believe that as time goes on I am gonna be very good or let me say PERFECT at whatever I wanna do. Life is a jurney, challenge, struggle and that's what makes it fun. I was listerning to Steve Harvey's motivational speech and I realized that even the greatest role model of all times experienced failures at some point in life but it's not about how many failures there have been in ones life but it is about how one always raises higher and stronger than the challenge at hand to overcome above everyone else. Moving higher above every challenge. NEVER GIVE UP!!!!, this is the antherm of every great person I ever known. I gotta do what I gotta do no matter what it is Imma still push HARDER. When things get hard, GO HARD. When it get great, GO HARDER. Never give in to any curcumstance. This part of what drived me in high school and I NEED 100% of it to drive me through out my life till I reach my goals. This would also motivate others to go harder and harder to also accomplish whatever dreams and ambission they got NEVER GIVE UP NO MATTER WHAT!!!</p>
