    I worked more on Mabdev's Restaurant website.
    
    <h1>Successful!!!</h1>
    <p>Let's move on coding.</p>

    <h3>But what, I did today is to fix my live-server go live problem. <br> and now I don't need to always Ctl+S all the time to save. I just type simply. </h3>

    Quite a lovely day tho.
